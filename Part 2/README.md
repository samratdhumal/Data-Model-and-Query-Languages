tions:
1. Both eH and eL born in 1965
2. eH's current salary is higher than eL's current salary
3. eH's hiring date is greater than eL, which means eH is a newer employee
than eL.
Sort the result by employee number of eH then employee number of el.
Result is shown as table below:
h_empno h_salary h_date l_empno l_salary l_date
10095 80955 1986-07-15 17206 55078 1986-02-25
10095 80955 1986-07-15 18617 66957 1986-06-28

 l date : eL's hire date
### 2.11 Problem 11

Customer Service 44.4988
Development 46.6018
...
As the gure shows, there are 51.9825 % employees in Development department
has their current salary above the average of current salary in Development
department.
### 2.13 Problem 13
Assuming a title is a node and a promotion is an edge between nodes. e.g.
And promotion from Engineer to Senior Engineer means their is a path from
Node 'Engineer' to Node 'Senior Engineer'. Find out pairs of node of source
and destination (src, dst) which there is no such path in the database. Sort the
result by src then dst. The result is shown as following:
src dst
Assistant Engineer Assistant Engineer
Engineer Assistant Engineer
...
The result table shows that there is no path from Assistant Engineer to Assistant
Engineer and neither Engineer to Assistant Engineer. That means there is no
one have been from Engineer and be promoted/demoted to Assistant Engineer
(no matter how many times of promotion/demotion) in the database.
### 2.14 Problem 14
Continued from problem 13, assumeing we treat the years from beginning of a
title until promotion as the distance between nodes. e.g. An employee started as
an Assistant Engineer from 1950-01-01 to 1955-12-31 then be promoted to En-
gineer on 1955-12-31. Then there is an edge between node "Assistant Engineer"
to "Engineer" with distance 6.
Calculate the average distance of all possible pair of titles and ordered by
source node. To simplify the problem, there is no need to consider months and
date when calculating the distance. Only year is required for calculating the
distance. Besides, we can assume the distances of any given pair is less than
100.
Sort the result by src then dst. The expected result is shown as follow:
src dst years
Assistant Engineer Engineer 7.7926
Assistant Engineer Manager 20.5266
...
Engineer Manager 12.7340
...
As the table shows, the average distance between node "Assistant Engineer" and
node "Engineer" is 7.7926. We add it with the distance between "Engineer"
to "Manager", which is 12.7340, to nd out the distance between "Assistant
Engineer" to "Manager" is 20.5266.
